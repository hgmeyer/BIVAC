# BIVAC
While navigating their environments it is essential for autonomous mobile systems to actively avoid collisions with obstacles. Flying insects perform this behavioural task with ease relying mainly on information the visual system provides. BIVAC (Bio-Inspired Visual Avoidance of Collisions) is a low-cost collision avoidance system based on the extraction of nearness information from visual motion. The system allows an autonomous mobile agent to navigate in cluttered environments while actively avoiding obstacles.
